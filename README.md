For the  1st step  I called it public variables here and I declare datatype called string and make a value name tokenName and 
I set  the value for "ADOR" after that lets set another data type called string and make a variable 
Name tokenAbbrv and the value is ADS for the uint public total supply I input a value of 0
for the mapping variable here mapping address = > uint public balance;
for the mapping variable this objects which can be preffered through the mapping run to access their values and 
their values can be re assigned
for the mint function, function mint address_address uint_value public and total supply I call the value for total supply 
Last for the burn function this is my codes for burn functions and after that lets go to solidity compiler 
Click the compile Mytoken1.sol wait the  greensign to appear after that go to the deploy and run transaction then find the deploy
Button then click it theni copy the account address scroll down click the arrow and this will appear in your screen
1st you need to paste your ID account address here in burn let's set the value of this burn to 800 then click transact as you can see guys this is the output
In mint lets put the address again and put the value of 500 then click transact 
Then lets click the balance put again the address then click balance and as u can see this is the output for the balance  here 
And for tokenAbbrv this is the output here and last for the totalSupply this is the output for totalSupply
